# Telephony information related to time zone detection.
#
# This is a proto file in text format.
#
# The file is used to generate the on-device file used when picking
# a time zone for an Android device.

# networks:
#
# A set of networks which use an MCC+MNC combination but *do not* actually
# operate in the country the MCC would suggest and therefore cause problems when
# MCC is used for country detection. There is no need to enter networks that
# operate in the country linked to the MCC. MCC+MNC combinations that operate
# in multiple countries where the MCC country is one of them must also not be
# entered here.
#
# The ordering of network elements is not important but is kept in ASCII
# order by MCC and MNC, then country ISO code for easier maintenance.
# There must only be one network element per MCC+MNC combination.

# countryIsoCode:
# The (lower cased) ISO 3166 2-character country code. Must be a known valid code.

# Countries / regions by Mobile Country Code (MCC).
#
# The table below is built from three main resources:
# 1) ITU "LIST OF MOBILE COUNTRY OR GEOGRAPHICAL AREA CODES (POSITION ON 1 FEBRUARY 2017)"
#    available here: http://handle.itu.int/11.1002/pub/80f1788f-en
# 2) The ISO 3166 country codes list, available here:
#    https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html
# 3) Android fine-tuning based on observations and reported errors
#
# This table may not be completely accurate.
#
# Entries are sorted by MCC (Asc). For MCCs that cover multiple countryIsoCodes, the first
# ISO code is considered "default" (often the one with the largest population).
