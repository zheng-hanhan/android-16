/**
 * TransactionManager helps track operations which should be retried if not
 * completed within a set amount of time.
 *
 * Transactions are long running operations identified by an ID. Further,
 * transactions can be grouped to ensure that only one transaction within a
 * group is outstanding at a time.
 *
 * This class is not thread-safe, so the caller must ensure all its methods are
 * invoked on the same thread that TimerPool callbacks are invoked on.
 *
 * Usage summary:
 *  - Call add() to initiate the transaction and assign an ID
 *    - TransactionManager will invoke the onTransactionAttempt() callback,
 *      either synchronously and immediately, or after any previous transactions
 *      in the same group have completed
 *  - Call remove() when the transaction's operation completes or is canceled
 *    - If not called within the timeout, TransactionManager will call
 *      onTransactionAttempt() again
 *    - If the operation times out after the specified maximum number of
 *      attempts, TransactionManager will call onTransactionFailure() and
 *      remove the transaction (note that this is the only circumstance under
 *      which onTransactionFailure() is called)
 *
 * @param kMaxTransactions The maximum number of pending transactions
 * (statically allocated)
 * @param TimerPoolType A chre::TimerPool-like class, which supports methods
 * with the same signature and semantics as TimerPool::setSystemTimer() and
 * TimerPool::cancelSystemTimer()
