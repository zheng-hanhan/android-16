/**
 * This class is used to detect duplicate reliable messages. It keeps a record
 * of all reliable messages that have been sent from the host. If a message with
 * the same message sequence number and host endpoint is sent again, it is
 * considered a duplicate. This class is not thread-safe.
 *
 * A typical usage of this class would be as follows:
 *
 * Call findOrAdd() to add a new message to the detector. If the message is a
 * duplicate, the detector will return the error code previously recorded.
 * If the message is not a duplicate, the detector will return an empty
 * Optional.
 *
 * Call findAndSetError() to set the error code for a message that has already
 * been added to the detector.
 *
 * Call removeOldEntries() to remove any messages that have been in the detector
 * for longer than the timeout specified in the constructor.
