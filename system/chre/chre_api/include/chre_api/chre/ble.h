 * Generic filters are used to filter for the presence of AD structures in the

 *
 * The CHRE generic filter structure represents a generic filter on an AD Type
 * as defined in the Bluetooth spec Assigned Numbers, Generic Access Profile
 * (ref: https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers/). This
 * generic structure is used by the Android HCI Advertising Packet Content
 * Filter (APCF) AD Type sub-command 0x09 (ref:
 * https://source.android.com/docs/core/connect/bluetooth/hci_requirements#le_apcf_command-ad_type_sub_cmd).
 *
 * The filter is matched when an advertisement event contains an AD structure in
 * its data field that matches the following criteria:
 *   AdStructure.type == type
 *   AdStructure.data & dataMask == data & dataMask
 *
 * The maximum data length is limited to the maximum possible legacy
 * advertisement payload data length (29 bytes). The data and dataMask must be
 * in OTA format. For each zero bit of the dataMask, the corresponding
 * data bit must also be zero.
 *
 * Note that the CHRE implementation may not support every kind of filter that
 * can be represented by this structure. Use chreBleGetFilterCapabilities() to
 * discover supported filtering capabilities at runtime.
 *
 * Example 1: To filter on a 16 bit service data UUID of 0xFE2C, the following
 * settings would be used:
 *   type = CHRE_BLE_AD_TYPE_SERVICE_DATA_WITH_UUID_16_LE
 *   len = 2
 *   data = {0x2C, 0xFE}
 *   dataMask = {0xFF, 0xFF}
 *
 * Example 2: To filter for manufacturer data of 0x12, 0x34 from Google (0x00E0),
 * the following settings would be used:
 *   type = CHRE_BLE_AD_TYPE_MANUFACTURER_DATA
 *   len = 4
 *   data = {0xE0, 0x00, 0x12, 0x34}
 *   dataMask = {0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF}

 * 1) The CHRE broadcaster address filter does not filter by address type at

 * 2) The broadcasterAddress must be in big endian byte order to match the

 *    https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothAdapter#getRemoteDevice(byte[])).
 *    This is intended to allow easier integration between nanoapp and Host
 *    code.
 *
 * The filter is matched when an advertisement even meets the following
 * criteria:
 *   broadcasterAddress == chreBleAdvertisingReport.address.
 *
 * Example: To filter on the address (01:02:03:AB:CD:EF), the following
