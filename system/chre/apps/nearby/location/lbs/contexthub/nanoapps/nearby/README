Nearby Offload supports applications to discover and interact with local
devices. Nearby Offload provides always-on discovery with low-latency and
minimal power consumption.

Currently, Nearby Offload supports the applications below.

* Fast Pair. Scan pheripherials in the background and helps Fast Pair to pop up
  the discovery notification as soon as a user turns on the screen.

* Nearby Presence. Always-on scan for Nearby Presence BLE advertisements.
  Applications can use this feature through Nearby Presence AOSP system API.

* Nearby Offload Extension. Nearby Offload can also be extended by OEMs to
  define their customized BLE discovery by plugging their implementation into
  the offload extension library.

Nearby Offload NanoApp is released to production by Google to support all the
applications above (Fast Pair, Presence, as well as Offload Extension).
