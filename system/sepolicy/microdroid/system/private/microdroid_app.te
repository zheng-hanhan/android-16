# microdroid_app is a domain for microdroid_launcher, which is a binary that
# loads a shared library from an apk and executes it by calling an entry point
# in the library. This can be considered as the native counterpart of
# app_process for Java.
#
# Both microdroid_launcher and payload from the shared library run in the
# context of microdroid_app.
