# **torq: AAOS Performance CLI**

**torq** is a command-line tool designed to streamline and standardize OS
performance profiling across Android Automotive devices. By providing a flexible
and easy-to-use interface, **torq** enables engineers and OEMs to capture and
analyze performance data for critical system events such as boot, user switch,
app startup, or any of their own interactions with their device. This tool helps
ensure consistent results amongst different users and helps reduce the time and
effort required for performance analysis, ensuring that developers can focus on
optimizing their systems and bug detection rather than navigating fragmented
tooling solutions.


## Getting Started

- **torq** is an open source Android tool. Run the following commands to get
started:

```
cd $ANDROID_ROOT
source build/envsetup.sh
lunch <target-name> (e.g., lunch sdk_gcar_x86_64-next-userdebug)
cd $ANDROID_ROOT/system/extras/torq
m torq
```

- Connect to an Android Automotive device or start an emulator.
- Ensure the connected device appears in `adb devices`.
- You can now run `torq` anywhere, followed by any necessary arguments
(e.g., `torq -d 7000`).


## Example Usages

### ./torq -d 7000
- Run a custom event for 7 seconds.
### ./torq -e user-switch --from-user 10 --to-user 11
- Run a user-switch event, switching from user 10 to user 11.
### ./torq -e boot --perfetto-config ./config
- Run a boot event, using the user's local Perfetto config specified in the
./config file path.
### ./torq -e boot -r 5 --between-dur-ms 3000
- Run a boot event 5 times, waiting 3 seconds between each boot run.
### ./torq -e app-startup -a android.google.kitchensink
- Run an app-startup event, starting the android.google.kitchensink package.
### ./torq -e user-switch --to-user 9 --serial emulator-5554
- Run a user-switch event, switching to user 9 on the connected device with
serial, emulator-5554.
### ./torq -p simpleperf -d 10000
- Run a custom event using the Simpleperf profiler for 10 seconds.
### ./torq -p simpleperf -s cpu-cycles -s instructions
- Run a custom event using the Simpleperf profiler, in which the stats,
cpu-cycles and instructions, are collected.
### ./torq -d 10000 --perfetto-config lightweight
- Run a custom event for 10 seconds using the "lightweight" predefined Perfetto
config.
### ./torq config show memory
- Print the contents of the memory predefined Perfetto config to the terminal.
### ./torq open trace.perfetto-trace
- Open a trace in the perfetto UI.
### ./torq -d 10000 --exclude-ftrace-event power/cpu_idle
- Run a custom event for 10 seconds, using the "default" predefined Perfetto
config, in which the ftrace event, power/cpu_idle, is not collected.

## Configure perfetto in virtualized Android

Working on a multi-VM environments has its challenges. In order to obtain a unified trace
containing the trace data from multiple VMs you could leverage Perfetto's *traced* and *traced_relay*
binaries. Torq provides commands to greatly simplify the configuration process.

For example, to switch a VM from using `traced` to `traced_relay`, you could run:
```console
torq vm traced-relay enable vsock://3:30001
```
To enable the relay producer port in `traced`, you could run:
```console
torq vm relay-producer enable
```

### CLI Arguments

These are the arguments for the `torq vm` CLI subcommand.

| Argument | Description | Currently Supported Arguments | Default |
|----------|-------------|-------------------------------|---------|
| `traced-relay enable <socket-address>` | Enables traced_relay and uses the *<socket-address>* as the relay socket to communicate with the central traced VM. |    |    |
| `traced-relay disable` | Disables traced_relay and switches to traced. |    |    |
| `relay-producer enable [--address <relay_producer_socket>]` | Enables traced's relay producer support. The `--address` specifies the relay producer socket to use. |    | --address: `vsock://-1:30001`  |
| `relay-producer disable` | Disables traced's relay producer support. |    |    |
